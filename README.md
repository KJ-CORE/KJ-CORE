## About Me

I'm a passionate systems developer with a deep focus on operating systems, kernel development, and low-level programming. My work centers on understanding how software interacts with hardware at the most fundamental level, with hands-on experience in kernel modules, system calls, and virtualization technologies.

I thrive on tackling complex problems in systems programming, from implementing custom kernel modules to building complete operating systems from scratch. My approach combines theoretical knowledge with practical experimentation to gain deep insights into computer architecture and OS design.

## Featured Projects

### Linux Kernel Development with QEMU
**Exploring Operating System Internals**

Utilized QEMU (Quick Emulation) to create a comprehensive virtualized environment for kernel development and testing. This project provided extensive hands-on experience with:

- Kernel internals, system calls, and low-level debugging techniques
- Implementation and testing of custom kernel modules in isolated environments
- In-depth exploration of process scheduling, memory management, and device drivers
- Safe experimentation with kernel modifications without risking system stability

**Technologies:** C, Assembly, QEMU, GDB, Linux Kernel
